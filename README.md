#First example from Kent Beck's 'Test Driven Development by Example' 

##Chapter 1: Multi-Currency Money

ToDo-List:
- [ ] $5 + 10CHF = $10 (exchange rate is 2:1)
- [ ] **$5 * 2 = $10**
- [ ] Make amount private
- [ ] Dollar side-effects?
- [ ] Money rounding?

*Take away*:
- make list of relevant tests to keep focused
- make test compile
- make test run as simply as possible
- generalize code by replacing constants with variables (remove duplication in test and production code -> eliminates dependency)
